I have been dealing with an autoimmune disease for almost 4 years now, I've been tested for many things and the doctors can't seem to find what exactly is wrong. It began with pain, swelling and stiffness in my feet and toes.A lot of the pain is joint stiffness and my skin feels like its being burned. Over time it has moved into my knees also. I am always tired. Recently I've been getting pains in my stomache and feeling sick. Does any of this sound like Lupus?? I've tested negative for it before, but the more I read about it I feel that's what i could have. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.	What is lupus?	0

The problem is that my binocular vision is not good enough and the eye-doctor meant it could be a problem if I sudden developed double vision.  Is there any operation that can fix this? The Orthoptics I went to meant there was a problem with one of the eye muscles which where to tight and the other too weak.

"Pilot and Lazy eye. Dear MedlinePus  I started to fly at the age of 15 and have been flying for over 3,5 years and has logged over 120 hours in my time as pilot. My dream is to become a Comerical Pilot and recently I undertook a medical class 1 which I failed in Norway because of my Eye position and Eye movment, hence I have not experienced any problem with my vision in daily life nor when I have been flying..  The problem is that my binocular vision is not good enough and the eye-doctor meant it could be a problem if I sudden developed double vision.  Is there any operation that can fix this? The Orthoptics I went to meant there was a problem with one of the eye muscles which where to tight and the other too weak. She said it can be fixed, but this is not ""normal""; in Norway because it is not big enough error she meant.  Is there anyway to fix this? I appreciate all information!
